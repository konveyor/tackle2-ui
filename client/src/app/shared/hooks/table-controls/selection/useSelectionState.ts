// TODO move useSelectionState as-is into here, rename to useLegacySelectionState
// TODO restructure useSelectionState and useSelectionUrlParams like the other concerns in table hooks - rely on idProperty, etc
// TODO figure out how to make the URL param piece of it optional? give useUrlParams a disabled flag? maybe make that optional for all the concerns? play around with that...
// TODO make useUrlParams just omit the param from the URL if it is using the default -- does this prevent all the history.replace thrashing on first page mount?
